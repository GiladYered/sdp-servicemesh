# LAB 09: Intelligent Routing with Istio

## Description

In this lab we will route all the traffic to the reviews service only to version 1 (currently it reach randomally v1, v2 or v3). Then we will update the route configuration so that all traffic from the user "jason" will be routed to the service reviews:v2

## Instructions

1. Let's reload the page multiple times, you will see that each time you will get a different version of the reviews service (v1, v2, v3)

```
http://<ingress-gateway-external-ip>/productpage
```

- Note: to get the gateway-external-ip you can use the following command 

```
kubectl get service istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```

--

2. Let's see what happen in the dashboard, access it from the following url

```
http://<kiali-external-ip>:20001/kiali
```

- Note: to retrieve the kiali-external-ip you can use the following command 

```
kubectl get svc kiali -n istio-system
```

- Note: Browse to the "Graph" section and select the "default" namespace to visualize the application

---

3. Before we can use Istio to control the Bookinfo version routing, weâ€™ll need to define the available versions, called subsets, in the destination rules. Let's inspect the destination rules resource that we will apply

```
cat $HOME/istio-1.8.0/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
```

---

4. Deploy the destination rules resource

```
kubectl apply -f $HOME/istio-1.8.0/samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml
```

---

5. Now we are ready to configure the virtual services to route to "v1" only. Let's inspect the resources that we'll apply

```
cat $HOME/istio-1.8.0/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
```

- Note: All services are routed to the version 1

---

6. Apply the VirtualService resource

```
kubectl apply -f $HOME/istio-1.8.0/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
```

---

7. Now reload the page multiple times, you will see that only version 1 of reviews is displayed each time

```
http://<ingress-gateway-external-ip>/productpage
```

8. Let's see what happen in the dashboard, access it from the following url

```
http://<kiali-external-ip>:20001/kiali
```

<kbd><img alt="istio" src="../images/istio-lab09-img03.png" width="80%" height="60%"></kbd>

---

9. Let's change the route configuration so that all traffic from the user "jason" will be routed to the service reviews:v2. For this, we will use the following virtual service configuration

```
cat $HOME/istio-1.8.0/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml
```

--- 

8. Apply the VirtualService resource

```
kubectl apply -f $HOME/istio-1.8.0/samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml
```

---

9. To test it, click Sign in from the top right corner of the page, and login using jason as user name with a blank password. You will only see reviews:v2 all the time. Others will see reviews:v1
